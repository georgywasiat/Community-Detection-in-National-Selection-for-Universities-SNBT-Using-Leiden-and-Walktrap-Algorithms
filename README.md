# Community Detection in National Selection for Universities (SNBT) Using Leiden and Walktrap Algorithms

The National Selection for State Universities (SNBT) utilizes the Leiden and Walktrap algorithms. The dataset used in this study comprises 2091 Twitter data points with keyword SNBT pil1 and pil2. SNBT is a crucial process in determining student admissions to universities. In this study, we employ the Leiden algorithm to identify communities within the SNBT network. This algorithm is effective in grouping students based on their network connection patterns. Furthermore, we apply the Walktrap algorithm to detect significant clusters within the SNBT network. This helps us identify groups of students with unique or unusual characteristics in the context of SNBT.

This study holds potential applications in supporting the SNBT process and gaining a better understanding of student characteristics.
